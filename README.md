# pythonprogrammer

In this track, you’ll learn how to manipulate data, write efficient Python code, and work with challenging data, including date and time data, text data, and web data using APIs. As your skills grow, you'll progress on to writing functions and unit testing—an essential skill needed to find bugs in your code before your users do! Through interactive exercises, you'll also gain experience of working with powerful Python libraries, including NumPy, pytest, and pycodestyle, that will help you perform key programmer tasks such as web development, data analysis, and task automation. Start this track and embark on your journey to becoming a Python programmer. Complete at least one course a day. My Target is


- Professional Data Analyst 

- Analytic Fundamentals 

- Data Management in SQL (PostgreSQL) 

- Exploratory Analysis with PostgreSQL 

- Exploratory Analysis (R or Python)

### Default arguments, variable-length arguments and scope

##### Types of scops

1. Global scope : object/variable out side of function. in the main body of the script

2. local scope: inside the function body and can not be accessed outside of the function defination.

3. Builtin scope: module, builtin functions from modules. Print(), sum()
